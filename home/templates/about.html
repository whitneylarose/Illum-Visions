                                        <p >Technology is ever changing and so are the people that use it.
                         With the great shift in our society’s values and priorities, Illum finds itself on the precipice of change.
                         Taking a different approach to technology design, Illum consults companies of all sizes to create products and services that extend to all races, genders, ethnicities, classes, ages, and all other identities.</p>

                    <p>We are a team of designers, researchers, engineers, and technologists that have come together to facilitate the shift towards a more inclusive future.</p>

                    <p>Illum represents the fire and passion that we need to rebalance this world.</p>

                    <p>The rise of technology has greatly shifted.
                        We are taking a different approach to things.

                     <h4 style="padding-bottom:2%;">Intersectionality</h4>
                    <h6>Wait! What is intersectionality? </h6>
                    <p>Intersectionality is a theoretical framework that carefully examines the complex nature of related
                        and interdependent social groupings such as race, gender, class, sexual orientation, and religion.
                        Through understanding the nature of people’s overlapping identities and experiences we are able to
                        understand the complexity of prejudices they face.</p>

                    <h6>Soo…. What does that have to do with technology? </h6>

                    <p>Technology is often created in the reflection of its users. However, many research studies show that
                        users within marginalized groups are often overlooked or ignored during the design process.
                    By taking an intersectional design approach, we help companies reach marginalized users that are
                        traditionally neglected by conventional design practices prompting designers to carefully examine
                        and eliminate their own biases.</p>

                <p style="text-align:right;">Empathy— one of the most important traits humans have the ability to demonstrate, is what guides us
                    through each step of our design process.
                    One of our biggest advantages is our ability to understand and share another person's experiences and emotions.
                    Our personal experiences and backgrounds position us to be able to empathize with marginalized
                    communities often forgotten and left behind by technology pushing us to work towards creating
                    technology that successfully uplifts their needs and wants.

                <p>We care!! Intersectional design is an emerging field that is often overlooked. This means that many
                    disenfranchised groups are not afforded the same technical opportunities as privileged groups.
                    Our passion is rooted in our compassion and desire for people of all backgrounds to have ample access
                    to technology as well as the opportunities and social mobility that access affords.
